EST-WA stands for Environmental Space and Time Web Analyzer

### Introduction
The idea behind this project is to create an application using Nasa Web WorldWind to show metadata about environmental variables in more than three dimensions. The model implemented to present 3D data is a Voxel model. 
Each voxel has three dimensions that will be possible to customize with the interested metadata, but also more information can be shown thanks to Web WorldWind capabilities. <br> The color of each Voxel present a variable in the dataset and additionally creating an animation in time gives the opportunity to introduce a further variable. 
Users can interact with the visualization, customizing the variables to show on the Voxels and filtering data according to specific settings.<br>
This projects participate in the Google Summer of Code 2016.
